##  Purpose

The purpose of the Portfolio website I have created is to showcase my HTML and CSS skills which have been recently learnt. This site can be a basis for which I can continue to build on with continued knowledge and experience. Any further projects can be added to the Projects page along with general updates to the sites functionality once I have gained more knowledge.

## Functionality and Feautures

The site was created to be responsive on all pages from resolutions of 320 x 568 (iPhone 5) up to full desktop resolutions. The portfolio was created with semantics heavily in mind so it could be read by screen readers if needed. Everything was marked up to have meaning with limited div and span elements used as containers for visual effects.

The features of the site were implemented to support the belief that the creator is an expereienced HTML and CSS user. The below features were implemented to the site to grab users attention while providing an interactive and informative experience while on the site.

Below is a list of pages and features that the site includes.

##### Pages  
-Home Page - acts as a landing and navigational page  
-Projects Page - contains skills, past projects and demonstration animations  
-About Me Page - A little bit about the creator  
-Blog Page - Contains links to five blog articles  
-Contact Me Page - Contains means to contact the creator and contact details

##### Features  
-A nav bar that floats at the top of every page  
-Text appearing when hovering over an image (using :hover CSS rule) on the About Me page  
-@Keyframes (%) used to create a reviews section where text would update every 10 seconds on the Projects page  
-@keyframes were also used to demostrate CSS skills by altering box appearances on the Projects page  
-Responsive design using @media queries to change the main axis of flex containers (turning a column into a row based on device size)  
-Contact Me form which, once filled out, generates an email containing information to be sent to the website creators address with the click of a button
