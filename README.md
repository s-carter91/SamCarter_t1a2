##  Purpose

The purpose of the Portfolio website I have created is to showcase my HTML and CSS skills which have been recently learnt. This site can be a basis for which I can continue to build on with continued knowledge and experience. Any further project can be added to the Projects page along with general updates to the sites functionality once I have consumed more information.

##  Functionality and Feautures

The site was created to be responsive on all pages from resolutions of 320 x 568 (iPhone 5) up to full desktop resolutions. The portfolio was created with semantics heavily in mind so it could be read by screen readers if needed. Everything was marked up to have meaning with limited div and span elements used as containers for visual effects. 

The features of the site were implemented to support the belief that the creator is an expereienced HTML and CSS user. The below features were implemented to the site to grab users attention while providing an interactive and informative experience on the site.

*Text appearing when hovering over an image (using :hover CSS rule)
*@Keyframes (%) used to create a reviews section where text would update every 10 seconds
*@keyframes were also used to demostrate CSS skills by altering box appearances
*Responsive design using @media queries to change the main axis of flex containers (turning a column into a row based on device size)
*Contact Me form which, once filled out, generates an email containing information to be sent to the website creators address with the click of a button
